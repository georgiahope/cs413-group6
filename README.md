##	Game Title: WordScramble

*	Jessie Gardner (jlp429)
* Vidal Martinez (vrm55)

##	Instructions
When the word scramble game is run, a title screen will appear instructing the
player to "Click to scramble". Upon this click, the player will be taken to the
puzzle room where they are given an empty board at the bottom of the screen and
an assortment of scrambled letters at the top of the screen that they must drag
and drop into the empty board to spell a word. If the word is misspelled, the
player will be sent to a fail screen and then back to the puzzle room where the
letters will have been re-scrambled. If a correct word is spelled then the player
will have won the game!

##	Known	Bugs	or	Issues
We wanted the player to be able to click the congrats screen after winning and
be sent back to the start screen to start a new game. For some reason, however,
this does not work. =(
